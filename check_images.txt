1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg
    to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Yes, all three models correctly identified the dog as a border collie.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg
    to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg?
    If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Yes, they were correct. No model had trouble with horizontal flip.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and
Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

* All were correct in terms of dog / not dog.
* vgg and resnet (disturbingly) identified the fake poop as a pretzel.
* alexnet identified the poop as "wool" but somehow I respect "pretzel" more.
* vgg and reset also identified the Grey Wolf breed correctly.
* alexnet correctly ID'ed the wolf as wolf-not-dog but the wolf breed was off.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture
that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you
selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

* This is a VERY small dataset. On my computer each run takes less than a second.
* Based on these 4 pictures it's a tie between VGG and ResNet.

** Based on runs of the slightly larger 40-picture dataset I'd say VGG is the most
    accurate, but also the slowest by a fairly large margin.

* While they were all successful with the *single* dog picture, these two
    engines did significantly better with the non-dogs.
* It's not very surprising that a horizontal flip did not change the result, since
    dogs don't really have many features dependent on left vs right sidedness. I can
    imagine this being more a problem for human facial recognition / individual ID.

* ResNet is significantly faster than VGG (on the large dataset) and almost as accurate.
* AlexNet is a little faster than ResNet.
    It seems to be slightly less accurate again than ResNet.
